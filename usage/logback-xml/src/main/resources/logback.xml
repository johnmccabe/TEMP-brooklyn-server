  <!-- the point of this file (and this project) is to supply a logging framework which:
  
       - makes it easy for a project to get the default logging 
         (include this project, perhaps as an optional dependency (not passed to downstream projects))
         
       - makes it easy for projects to customise that logging
         (override the logback-main.xml file this includes, or any of the files that includes;
         NB those files are in brooklyn-logback-includes)
         
       - makes it easy for projects to opt-out of this type of logging
         (ensure it does not include this project as a dependency)
         
       the core problem this solves is that logback does not like it if there are multiple 
       `logback.xml` files. this restriction does not apply to files included by logback.xml.
