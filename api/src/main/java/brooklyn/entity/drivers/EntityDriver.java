 * The EntityDriver provides an abstraction between the Entity and the environment (the {@link Location} it is running
 * in, so that an entity is not tightly coupled to a specific Location. E.g. you could have a TomcatEntity that uses
 * a TomcatDriver (an interface) and you could have different driver implementations like the
 * TomcatSshDriver/TomcatWindowsDriver and if in the future support for Puppet needs to be added, a TomcatPuppetDriver
 * could be added.
