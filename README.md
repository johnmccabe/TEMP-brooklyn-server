# [![**Brooklyn**](http://brooklyncentral.github.io/style/images/brooklyn.gif)](http://brooklyncentral.github.com)

Brooklyn is a library and control plane for deploying and managing distributed applications.

See [brooklyncentral.github.com](http://brooklyncentral.github.com) for details and examples.

## What?

Brooklyn is a management tool for applications hosted in one or more clouds (or other locations).


## Quick Start

Three quick start options are available:

* [Getting started guide](http://brooklyncentral.github.io/use/guide/quickstart/index.html)
* [Download the latest release](https://github.com/brooklyncentral/brooklyn/tarball/master).
* Clone the repo: `git clone git://github.com/brooklyncentral/brooklyn.git`.

## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Brooklyn will be maintained under the [Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/).

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

Milestone (`<major>.<minor>.<patch>-M<milestone>`) and Release Candidate (`<major>.<minor>.<patch>-rc.<candidate>`) are used in the release process.
